#A.I. Aupair Finder

##A.I. Python code to assist in finding an au-pair by analysis of texts they have written about themselves (or how to fix a sites broken search mechanism)

### Background / Motivation

I have kids and I'm not independently wealthy. 
That means that in order to feed aforementioned children, I must work. The kind of job that I can do is the typical office hours and pretty much I need to be *in* the office for those hours.
And of course when I'm at work, the children need to be looked after. 
It's a kind of legal thing and some societies would say a responsibility thing about having kids in the first place.

Luckily, the children are all of full time school age now .. however as much as I've tried to find schools that run between 8am and 7pm, I'm informed that they really do like to let the children free from around 3.30pm.

So for the observant of you, that leaves between 3.30pm and the time I return home (approx 7.30pm) of time where someone else needs to be looking after the kiddlywinkles, lest they start their experiments with cats and microwaves (again)*.

Now luckily there is a profession category of individuals who are willing to look after children in exchange predominantly for lodging / food / no bills and what is often termed by tax authorities as "pocket money" for compensation. These helpful individuals are known as "au-pairs".

However... There are issues in finding them.

The first problem is finding suitable aupairs to interview. One can either go via an agency (in which case the fees are quite high for a first level of filtering), or you can use one of the many websites that connect families with au-pairs.
I say "many" .. but unfortunately there is basically just one and due to the network effect, it has the monopoly (good for them I say - well done for making a business out of it).
Well the downside of this is there is very little reason to compete if there is no competition. And because of this, their ways of searching are pretty much dreadful.

*I'm just kidding about that bit obviously.
